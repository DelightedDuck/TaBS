# TaBS
Text Based Scratch

TaBS is in VERY early stages. Right now you can only do one thing...

```
print "what you want to print (this will show up in the output, make sure it's in quotes!)"
```

You can click run to see the output.
This is meant to be a successor to the now outdated Tosh.

Coming soon: Sprite upload, Sound upload, Well, a recreation of all the scratch blocks.
